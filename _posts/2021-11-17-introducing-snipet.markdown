I'm a lazy person, I usually don't memorize codes, unless I memorize them by using them over and over.

One weekend, I had a little free time, so I decided to create this bad boy, [Snipet][snipet].

I knew that there are some great alternatives out there, like [Github Gists][github-gist], but I wanted to create it myself with of course learning purposes.

Here are some of the features you can enjoy:
1. Make code snippets private or public.
2. Syntax highlighting for almost every language.
3. Add title and descriptions for code snippets.
4. Add tags to them.

I'll appreciate the [Stars][snipet-github-star], [Issues][snipet-github-issues], and [Pull Requests][snipet-github-pr] on this Repo.
